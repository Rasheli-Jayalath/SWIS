                                   The Tarbela 4th Extension Hydropower Project (T4HP) has been proposed to add
generating capacity on Tunnel 4. The demand for power in the country is rapidly
increasing with eight percent per year and there are frequent periods with load shedding
all over the country. Currently there is an estimated shortfall of 7,311 MW in winter and
3,347 MW in summer.</p>
<p>
The construction of a new hydropower plant at Tarbela with 1,410 MW additional
generating capacity would enable maximum utilization of the available power potential
and make an important contribution to the overall power supply in the country. </p>
                                 <p> The project is considered to be very attractive and a “low risk- high reward” operation
aimed at providing over 3,871 GWh annually of least-cost low-carbon renewable energy.
This is so attractive because the dam, storage reservoir and tunnel are already constructed
and water supply is assured.</p>
<p>Another important advantage in development of T4HP is that it will be free of
resettlement and litigation problems, which are often major causes of delay in hydroelectric
projects. Environmental and social issues are relatively minor, since most of the
infrastructure is already in place. Basic infrastructure and other facilities like offices,
labor camps and residential accommodation are largely available and only have to be
renovated and possibly expanded against modest cost. The installation of additional
generating capacity will not influence the irrigation release capacity of the dam. </p>
